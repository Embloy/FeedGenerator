# FeedGenerator

**Feed algorithm used to create custom job feeds (similar to Instagram) for users based on their preferences and a batch of jobs.**

> [!NOTE]
> This project is unrelated to the current [embloy.com](https://embloy.com) service and consists of deprecated code from a prior project.

## FUNCTIONALITY

This repository contains the code for the [FeedGenerator-API](https://embloy-fg-api.onrender.com) that was used for an early test version
by [embloy.com](https://embloy.com) to generate a feed from a set of jobs that matches with the user's preferences.

This API supports [TLS (Transport Layer Security) Encryption](https://actix.rs/docs/server#tls--https):
> The ***cert.pem*** file contains the TLS certificate that is
> issued to your domain by a Certificate Authority (CA).
> This certificate is used to authenticate
> your server to clients, proving that the server is indeed the server that the client is trying to
> communicate with.
> The certificate contains information such as the domain name it's issued for,
> the issuer's information, and the public key.

> The ***key.pem*** file contains the private key that
> corresponds to the public key in the ***cert.pem*** file. This key is used to encrypt the data that is
> being sent between the client and the server. Both files are required for TLS encryption to
> work properly, and should be kept secure as they grant access to sensitive information.

For testing purposes load TLS keys to create a self-signed temporary cert:

```
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/CN=localhost'
```
